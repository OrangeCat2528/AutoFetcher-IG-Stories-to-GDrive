## How to Use

1. Create a new App Script project in your Google account, and open the project in the App Script Editor.

2. Copy the scripts under the `gascript` folder to your App Script Editor.

3. Open `code.js` and replace the following variables with your own values, and save the file.

    ```js
    // User-defined Variables
    var g_username = 'your username for this app';
    var g_password = 'your password for this app';
    var gdrive_id = 'your google drive folder id for storing the downloaded files';
    var lastlog_id = '<your google doc ID for storing last tracking log>';
    var historylog_id = '<your google doc ID for storing history log>';
    var crashReportEmail = '<your email for receiving crash report>';

    // New variables in Build 2020.10.08
    var statusBadge_id = '<your google drive file ID of Test Status Badge>';
    var lastTestedBadge_id = '<your google drive file ID of Last Tested Badge>';

    // New variables in Build 2020.06.02
    var lastTestedBadge_id = '<your google drive file ID of Last Tested Badge>';
    var query_hash = '<your IG query_hash for story look up>';
    var COOKIE = 'The cookie passed in request header to keep a user logged in';
    ```

4. Deploy the updated App Script project as a web application, and authorize the app to read and write files in your Google Drive.

5. Copy the URL of the deployed web application, like `https://script.google.com/<your-app-path>/exec?`

Now you can test the application by passing a url like this, `https://script.google.com/<your-app-path>/exec?usr=<app_username>&pwd=<app_password>&target={"target":{"name":"nasa","id":"528817151"}}`.

`ig_user_id` is necessary to query the data of the target Instagram user from the official web API. You can obtain the ID with the username by using [the ID finder powered by The Code of a Ninja](https://codeofaninja.com/tools/find-instagram-user-id). The application will track and download the photos and videos to your Google Drive folder, if it finds any new IG stories from the target Instagram account.

## How to find your IG cookie

1. Visit `www.instagram.com` and login to your account using a desktop browser, such as Chrome or Firefox.
2. Open the DevTool by pressing **F12** or choose **Inspect** from the right-click menu on the page.
3. Open the Network tab, then reload the page.
4. Select `www.instagram.com` from the list of request items and explore its Headers.

## Configure Crash Report

For Build 2020.06.05, a new function called `test_pipeline()` has been added to check if there are any stories shown from the Instagram accounts of BBCNews, NASA and Medium. Since they publish stories frequently, there should be always one or more items available. The function will send an email to your specified email address if it fetches no URLs to download.

1. Enter your email to `historylog_id` in line 7.

2. Go to your Google Developer Hub, and create a new trigger for this project.

3. In the Add Trigger Dialog, choose **test_pipeline** and select Daily timer.
